## Abstract
This AI agent, developed using Anthropic's **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) and the **LangGraph/LangChain** framework, uses predefined tools, prompts, and resources to work with a supply chain company's data. It can reason about user requests and execute Python code in a secure and controlled environment to respond to them, allowing it to act as an advanced data analyst capable of detecting patterns, analyzing trends, making forecasts, and answering business questions. It was designed to be a valuable tool for company executives, enabling them to make data-driven business decisions quickly and efficiently.
